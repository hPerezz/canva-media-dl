# Canva Media Downloader

A lightweight Chrome extension to download images and videos you have access to from Canva pages.

## Why
Canva does not always provide a direct way to download every image visible inside a design page (outside of the standard export flow). This extension surfaces media URLs on the current Canva page and lets you download them.

## Features
- Lists images and videos found on the current Canva tab
- One-click download from the popup
- Right-click context menu download on Canva pages

## Installation (Chrome)
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right).
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select this folder:
   - `/Users/perez/Documents/Code/canva-image-downloader`

## Usage
1. Open a Canva page with your design.
2. Click the extension icon.
3. Click any thumbnail to download the file.

Optional:
- Right-click a media item on Canva and select the download option.

## Notes
- This extension grabs media URLs already loaded in your browser.
- Filenames are auto-generated; Chrome will prompt you to choose where to save.
